Fusion is a tiny stream processing library written in `Go`.

See [reactor](https://github.com/spy16/reactor) for a stream processing tool built using fusion. 

## Features

* Simple & lightweight.
* Highly Composable. Compose `Proc` implementations in a way that is similar to middleware pattern to get concurrent
  processing, automatic retries etc.
* Use for simple single node or more complex distributed setup by using different
  `fusion.Stream` and `fusion.Proc` implementations.
* Zero dependencies.

## Usage

A simple line counter implementation:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"sync/atomic"
	"github.com/spy16/fusion"
)

func main() {
	count := int64(0)
	runner := fusion.Runner{
      Stream: &fusion.LineStream{From: os.Stdin},
      Proc: &fusion.Fn{
      	Workers: 5,
      	Func: func(ctx context.Context, msg fusion.Msg) error {
      	  atomic.AddInt64(&count, 1)
      	  return nil
      	},
      },
	}
	_ = runner.Run(context.Background())
	fmt.Printf("Count=%d\n", count)
}
```
